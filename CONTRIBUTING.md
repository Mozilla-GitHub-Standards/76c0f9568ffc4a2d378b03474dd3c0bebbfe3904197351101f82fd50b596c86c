## Bug Reports ##

You can file issues here on GitHub. Please try to include as much information as you can and under what conditions
you saw the issue.

## Sending Pull Requests ##

Patches should be submitted as pull requests (PR).

Before submitting a PR:
- Your code must run and pass all the automated tests before you submit your PR for review. "Work in progress" pull requests are allowed to be submitted, but should be clearly labeled as such and should not be merged until all tests pass and the code has been reviews. 
  - Run `grunt lint` to make sure your code passes linting.
  - Run `npm test` to make sure all tests still pass.
- Your patch should include new tests that cover your changes. It is your and your reviewer's responsibility to ensure your patch includes adequate tests.

When submitting a PR:
- You agree to license your code under the project's open source license ([MPL 2.0](/LICENSE)).
- Base your branch off the current `master` (see below for an example workflow).
- Add both your code and new tests if relevant.
- Run `grunt lint` and `npm test` to make sure your code passes linting and tests.
- Please do not include merge commits in pull requests; include only commits with the new relevant code.

See the main [README.md](/README.md) for information on prerequisites, installing, running and testing.

## Git Commit Guidelines

We loosely follow the [Angular commit guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#type) of `<type>(<scope>): <subject>` where `type` must be one of:

* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing
  semi-colons, etc)
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **test**: Adding missing tests
* **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation
  generation

## Documentation

Running `grunt doc` will create a `docs` directory, browse the documentation by opening `docs/index.html`.

Write documentation using [YUIDoc Syntax](http://yui.github.io/yuidoc/syntax/).
